            The first Mazinger, the story revolves around the antagonism between Kouji Kabuto piloting his robot
            Mazinger Z and Dr. Hell using Mechanical Beasts. Mazinger has two manga, one by Go Nagai himself, and the
            other by his assistant, Gosaku Ota both with different stories and direction. In 1993, a side-scrolling
            action video game titled "Mazinger Z" was released in Japan by Bandai for the Super Famicom gaming console.
            In 1994, Banpresto released a vertical shoot 'em up coin-op game titled "Mazinger Z", which included
            Mazinger Z, Great Mazinger, and Grendizer, as playable super robot characters.

                <li>
                    In his Manga Works series, Go Nagai reveals that he had always loved Tetsuwan Atom and Tetsujin-28
                    as a child, and wanted to make his own robot anime.[1] However, for the longest time he was unable
                    to produce a concept that he felt did not borrow too heavily from those two shows. One day, Nagai
                    observed a traffic jam and mused to himself that the drivers in back would surely love a way to
                    bypass the ones in front. From that thought came his ultimate inspiration: a giant robot that could
                    be controlled from the inside, like a car. In his original concepts, the titular robot was Energer
                    Z, which was controlled by a motorcycle that was driven up its back and into its head (an idea which
                    was recycled for the Diana A robot). However, with the sudden popularity of Kamen Rider, Nagai
                    replaced the motorcycle with a hovercraft. He later redesigned Energer Z, renaming it Mazinger Z to
                    evoke the image of a demon god (Ma, 魔, meaning demon and Jin, 神, meaning god). The motif of the
                    Hover Pilder docking itself into Mazinger's head also borrows from Nagai's 1971 manga Demon Lord
                    Dante (the prototype for his more popular Devilman), in which the titular giant demon has a human
                    head (of Ryo Utsugi, the young man who merged with him) in his forehead. Koji Kabuto takes his
                    surname (the Japanese word for a helmet) because he controls Mazinger Z from its head.

                    The story centers on Tetsuya Tsurugi (剣 鉄也, Tsurugi Tetsuya), an orphan raised by Kenzo Kabuto (兜
                    剣造, Kabuto Kenzō), who is the once thought dead father of Mazinger Z pilot Kouji Kabuto. Kenzo
                    Kabuto is the creator of the new and improved version of Mazinger, which was based on his father's
                    "Chogokin Z" (Super Alloy Z). The new version was designed with a stronger form to fight against
                    humanity's new enemy, the Mycenae Empire, led by the Great General of Darkness and his army of
                    Battle Beasts. Kabuto, then, gives the Great Mazinger to Tetsuya for him to use. Accompanying him is
                    his female companion, Jun Hono, an orphaned half Japanese, half African-American girl, in her
                    feminine robot, "Venus A (Venus Ace)".

                <li>
                    Tetsuya's training with Great Mazinger is completed just in time to come to Kabuto's aid as the
                    Mycenae Battle Beasts overwhelm Mazinger Z. With the original Mazinger destroyed, Kabuto went to
                    America to study space travel and left Japan's defense in the hands of Tetsuya and the Fortress of
                    Science. Nevertheless, Tetsuya won against his fight with the Mycenae Battle Beasts, led by their
                    military leader, Ankoku Daishogun (Great General of Darkness). After the Great General of Darkness'
                    defeat, Doctor Hell of Mazinger Z went into disguise as the Great Marshall of Hell and leads the
                    Mycenae forces.
